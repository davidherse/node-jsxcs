# JSXCS

Wrapper around [jscs](https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs) to allow running jscs for JSX files.

## How to install
    npm install jsxcs -g

## How to use
See [jscs](https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs) for guides.

## Caveats
As jsxcs works by ignoring errors on lines that are generated by the JSX transformer, some errors with actual user made styling issues might get omitted.
